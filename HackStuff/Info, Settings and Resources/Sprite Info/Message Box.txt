Sprite 1E

The hex-to-hex conversion for specifying the level number in the extra property:

Level 23 = 23
Level 24 = 24

Level 101 = 25
102 = 26
103 = 27
104 = 28
105 = 29
106 = 2A

, etc. Remember that, like the vanilla, which one of the two possible messages it will display for each (sub)level is x-position dependent.
