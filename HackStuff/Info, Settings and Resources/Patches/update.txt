Fix a flaw that if you are crouching on a lakitu's cloud or p-balloon (the p-balloon crouch
can be done by touching it while crouching), you can still go under stuff. This is due to the
fact that $73 and $19 has “opposite” flags for a hitbox size: to have 16x32 hitbox, $73 has
to be clear AND $19 has to be set. To have 16x16, have $19 be clear OR $73 set.
